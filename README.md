# hydroline-hydcraft-services

> [中文](README_zh.md). Hydroline HydCraft Services is a **customized service system built specifically for the HydCraft Minecraft server**.

This project is tightly integrated with the broader **Hydroline ecosystem**, and works in coordination with components such as the [Beacon](https://github.com/Hydroline/beacon), [Beacon Provider](https://github.com/Hydroline/beacon-provider), [OAuth Proxy](https://github.com/Hydroline/oauth-proxy), [Minecraft Skin Proxy](https://github.com/Hydroline/minecraft-skin-proxy), [HydCraft Client Agent](https://github.com/Hydroline/hydcraft-client-agent), [HydCraft Client Patcher](https://github.com/Hydroline/hydcraft-client-patcher), [Foundry](https://github.com/Hydroline/foundry) and several auxiliary services (see [Hydroline org repo](https://github.com/orgs/Hydroline/repositories)). Together, they form a unified backend infrastructure for server operation, data collection, and player-facing services.

[Hydroline Services](https://github.com/Hydroline/hydroline-services) is a low-code platform built on this project (`hydroline-hydcraft-services`). Development of Hydroline Services will begin once this project enters maintenance mode.

At its core, the project focuses on **bridging Minecraft runtime data with real-world server management needs**. It provides features including (but not limited to):

- Map & GIS integration (Leaflet-compatible)
- Company / organization management
- Server status fetching and monitoring
- In-game online chat synchronization
- Modpack metadata and distribution support
- Extensible service modules for future expansion

The service is built with a **modern TypeScript-based tech stack**, featuring:

- **Node.js** and **NestJS** for the backend
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database
- **Vue 3 + Vite** for the frontend
- **Prisma** for schema and database management
- **OAuth** for authentication
- **S3-compatible object storage** for assets and uploads

The project is currently under **active and rapid iteration**, so internal structure and modules may evolve frequently. Through deep integration with other Hydroline services, the system aims to form a **cohesive, full-coverage service ecosystem** for the HydCraft server.

## Layout

This repository is organized as a **pnpm workspace**, following a clear frontend–backend separation.

```
root
├── .agents/          # Client / agent session data
├── backend/          # Backend (NestJS + TypeScript)
├── frontend/         # Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript)
└── package.json      # pnpm workspace configuration
```

Both the backend and frontend are managed from the root workspace.

## Development

To start the project, run the backend and frontend separately from the root directory:

```bash
pnpm backend:start
pnpm frontend:dev
```

Running them in two terminals is recommended (VS Code split terminals work great).

## Tooling

1. Configure the backend environment variables by copying:

   ```
   backend/.env.sample → backend/.env
   ```

2. Prisma-related commands can be found in `backend/package.json`, including:

   - `pnpm db:push`
   - `pnpm db:generate`
   - other database utilities

3. Code formatting for **both backend and frontend** can be applied from the root workspace:

   ```bash
   pnpm format:write
   ```

   This uses Prettier to keep the entire codebase consistent.

## Ecosystem

This project only includes the web portion. For other features in the project (such as client distribution, viewing Minecraft server data, and Google OAuth proxy), the following additional services are required:

- Minecraft server data collection: [Beacon](https://github.com/Hydroline/beacon), [Beacon Provider](https://github.com/Hydroline/beacon-provider)

- Proxy services: [OAuth Proxy](https://github.com/Hydroline/oauth-proxy), [Minecraft Skin Proxy](https://github.com/Hydroline/minecraft-skin-proxy)

- Minecraft client distribution: [HydCraft Client Agent](https://github.com/Hydroline/hydcraft-client-agent), [HydCraft Client Patcher](https://github.com/Hydroline/hydcraft-client-patcher), [Foundry](https://github.com/Hydroline/foundry)
